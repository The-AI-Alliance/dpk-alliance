# Testing transforms

The project implementation was extensively tested using two main classes:

* [data_access_test](data_access/data_access_factory_test.py)
* [binary transform test](transform/binary_transform_test.py)
* [table transform test](transform/table_transform_test.py)
* [transform_launcher_test](launch/transform_test.py)

Examples of testing usage can be found in project test [here](../../../test/transform/python)
and [here](../../../test/transform/ray)
